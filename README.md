Generate a user interface for a SaaS application that allows users to create and share professional digital business cards. The UI should consist of the following sections:
1. Landing Page:
    Create a hero section with a compelling headline (e.g., "Craft Stunning Digital Business Cards Instantly") and a subheading emphasizing the benefits (e.g., "Leave a Lasting Impression. Share Your Contact Details with Ease").
    Include a prominent call-to-action button, such as "Get Started Free" or "Try It Now."
2. Login/Signup:
    Offer secure login options using email, Google, and Facebook/Meta.
    Design a clean and user-friendly login form with email and password fields.
3. Profile Creation Form:
    Create a well-organized form with fields for users to enter their:
        Name
        Contact Number
        Email Address
        Profile Picture upload (accepting JPEG and PNG formats)
        Short Bio (optional, with a character limit)
    Ensure a clear and uncluttered layout with appropriate labels for each field.
4. Template Selection:
    Display a dedicated section showcasing a variety of pre-designed business card templates.
    Each template thumbnail should be visually appealing, reflecting professional, elegant, or bright color themes.
    Users should be able to easily select their preferred template with a clear indication (e.g., checkmark or highlight).
5. Card Generation & Editing:
    After selecting a template, the user's information from the profile creation form should automatically populate the chosen template.
    Allow users basic editing options to personalize their cards, such as:
        Text formatting (font style, size, color)
        Color adjustments for specific elements (background, text, accents)
    Maintain a simple editing interface to avoid overwhelming users.
6. Sharing Functionality:
    Generate a unique shareable link for each created digital business card.
    Include clear options for users to easily copy the link or share it directly on social media platforms.
7. Responsiveness:
    Emphasize that the entire UI design must be fully responsive and adapt seamlessly across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
